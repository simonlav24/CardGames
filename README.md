# 🃏 Python Card Game System

![Alt text](assets/example.png?raw=true "example")

A **just-for-fun Python project** exploring the design of a flexible and extensible system for building card games — both **single-player** and **multiplayer**.
It implements core systems for card management, rule logic, and turn handling, along with example games built on top of them.

The main goal is to experiment with **clean architecture** that clearly separates game logic, rules, and UI/IO layers.

## 🕹️ Implemented Games

* Klondike solitaire
* Spider solitaire
* Shithead (multiplayer + AI player)
* Durak (multiplayer + AI player)
* Card Capture
* Egyptian Ratscrew (planned)
